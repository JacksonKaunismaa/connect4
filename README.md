# Connect 4 reinforcement learning agent

The first component, the self-learning module, uses deep reinforcement learning to train a residual CNN to play connect 4 on an 8x8 board.

The second component, the connect_4_AB module, uses an alpha-beta search, bit boards, and a simple evaluation function (win/loss).
